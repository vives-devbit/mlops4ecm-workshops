# 09 – Train on S3 Dataset

<img src="../../media/machine-learning.jpg" style="width: 300px" align="right">

> Move your training dataset to S3 and modify your code to load it from object storage instead of local disk — just like in cloud pipelines.

Upload your dataset to MinIO and modify your training script to load data from S3. You will now train your model without touching local disk, mimicking how training pipelines work in scalable cloud environments.

Bonus: add some versioning, like timestamps, in the filenames.
