Set up GitHub Actions to automatically check pull requests. Add workflows for formatting (black, ruff) and automated testing (pytest). Ensure that every change to your codebase is checked before being merged.

- One of the tests could be: run_training.py script sanity (e.g. does it run 1 epoch without error?)
