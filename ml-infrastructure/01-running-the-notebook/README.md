# 01 ‚Äì Running the Notebook

<img src="../../media/jupyter-notebooks-exploration-analogy-paper.jpg" style="width: 300px" align="right">

Welcome to the starting point of your machine learning journey.

In this exercise, you'll:

* Connect to your development virtual machine.
* Set up a Python virtual environment.
* Install the Python dependencies.
* Run the Jupyter Notebook that trains a MobileNet classifier on grocery item images.

## üöÄ Exercise Instructions

### Set up Visual Studio Code with Remote SSH

<img src="../../media/vscode-logo-name.jpg" style="width: 300px" align="right">

You can connect to the VM using regular SSH in a terminal, but for this course, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code‚Äôs Remote SSH** feature, which gives you access to both the terminal and file system directly inside the editor.

* Open **Visual Studio Code** on your local machine.
* Install the **Remote - SSH** extension (if not already installed).
* Click the **blue or green button in the bottom left corner**, or press `F1` and choose **‚ÄúRemote-SSH: Connect to Host‚Ä¶‚Äù**.
* Enter your SSH target, for example:

  ```
  root@your-vm-ip
  ```

* VS Code may ask you if you **trust the remote machine** ‚Äì click **Yes**.
* It will ask **where to store your SSH configuration** ‚Äì just pick the **first option**.
* Once connected, VS Code will open a **remote window** linked to your virtual machine.
* Finally, it will ask **what operating system the remote machine is** ‚Äì choose **Linux**.

Note: If you prefer the command line or want to quickly check VM access, you can also SSH from your terminal using `ssh root@ip-address`.

### Clone the course repository

Once you're connected to the remote machine via VS Code:

* Open the terminal by clicking on **"View" ‚Üí "Terminal"** in the top menu.
* This will open a terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code interface.

Then run the following command to clone the course repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vives-devbit/<date>-mlops-workshops.git
```

Replace `<date>` with the actual date of your workshop.

This will download all course materials onto your virtual machine.

After cloning, to open the folder in **VS Code**:

* Click on **"File" ‚Üí "Open Folder..."**
* Navigate to the cloned folder (`<date>-mlops-workshops` in your home directory)
* Click **"OK"**
* VS Code may ask you if you **trust the authors** of this folder ‚Äì just click "Yes"

This will load the repository into your VS Code workspace so you can explore and edit files easily.

### Navigate to the first exercise folder

Inside the project, navigate to:

```
ml-infrastructure/01-running-the-notebook/
```

Here you‚Äôll find a training notebook that we‚Äôll use in the next step.

### Set up the Python environment in VS Code

<img src="../../media/vscode-notebook-demo.png" style="width: 300px" align="right">

Open the notebook file `grocery-store.ipynb` in VS Code and try running the cells.

When you try to run a cell, VS Code may prompt you to install recommended extensions like **Python** and **Jupyter**.

> Go ahead and install them if prompted.

Then, VS Code will ask you to **select a kernel**. Choose:

‚û°Ô∏è **Python Environments** ‚Üí **Create Python Environment**

Follow these steps:

1. **Select `Venv`** ‚Äì this creates a `.venv` folder in your current workspace.
2. **Choose the default interpreter** ‚Äì usually something like **Python 3.11**.
3. **For dependencies**, select the `requirements.txt` file inside the `01-running-the-notebook` folder.
4. Click **‚ÄúOK‚Äù**.

VS Code will now automatically create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies.

### Run the notebook

Once the setup is complete, try running the notebook cells again.

You should now see:

* A training loop using MobileNetV3.
* Output showing training loss and validation accuracy.
* Some example predictions visualized inline.

Congratulations! You've just trained and evaluated your first image classifier.

### üí° Note for advanced users

If you prefer to set up the environment manually via the terminal, you can do so:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then reopen the notebook and select this virtual environment as your kernel.

### See what changed in the notebook

Before moving on, let‚Äôs take a moment to look at what actually changed when you ran the notebook.

#### üß≠ Using the VS Code interface:

1. Click on the **Source Control** icon in the left-hand sidebar (the one that looks like a branch or Y-shape).
2. You‚Äôll see one or more **pending changes** listed‚Äîmost notably, `grocery-store.ipynb`.
3. Click on the notebook file in the list to see a **visual diff**.

VS Code will show you what changed inside the notebook:

* Execution counts
* Metadata like timestamps or kernel info
* Cell outputs (e.g. training progress, printed results)

Even though you didn‚Äôt change your actual code, you‚Äôll see a **lot of noise** in the diff. This is a great example of why notebooks are hard to track with Git.

> üí° This is one of the main reasons we‚Äôll move to Python scripts in the next step ‚Äî scripts produce clean, readable diffs that are much easier to review and version.

#### üß† Optional: View the same in the terminal

If you‚Äôre curious, you can also see the raw diff using the terminal:

```bash
git diff
```

This will dump the changes in plain text ‚Äî note how verbose and unreadable the notebook format becomes!

## ‚úÖ Next Step

Once you've successfully run the notebook, you're ready to move on to the next exercise: **refactoring the notebook into reusable Python scripts.**
