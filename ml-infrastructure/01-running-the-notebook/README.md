> Set up a virtual machine, configure your Python environment, and run a notebook that trains a MobileNet classifier on grocery item images.

Welcome to the starting point of your machine learning journey.

In this exercise, you'll:

* Connect to your development virtual machine.
* Set up a Python virtual environment.
* Install the Python dependencies.
* Run the Jupyter Notebook that trains a MobileNet classifier on grocery item images.

## üöÄ Exercise Instructions

### Set up Visual Studio Code with Remote SSH

<img src="../../media/vscode-logo-name.jpg" style="width: 300px" align="right">

You can connect to the VM using regular SSH in a terminal, but for this course, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code‚Äôs Remote SSH** feature, which gives you access to both the terminal and file system directly inside the editor.

* Open **Visual Studio Code** on your local machine.
* Install the **Remote - SSH** extension (if not already installed).
* Click the **blue or green button in the bottom left corner**, or press `F1` and choose **‚ÄúRemote-SSH: Connect to Host‚Ä¶‚Äù**.
* Enter your SSH target, for example:

  ```
  root@your-vm-ip
  ```

* VS Code may ask you if you **trust the remote machine** ‚Äì click **Yes**.
* It will ask **where to store your SSH configuration** ‚Äì just pick the **first option**.
* Once connected, VS Code will open a **remote window** linked to your virtual machine.
* Finally, it will ask **what operating system the remote machine is** ‚Äì choose **Linux**.

Note: If you prefer the command line or want to quickly check VM access, you can also SSH from your terminal using `ssh root@ip-address`.

### Clone the course repository

Once you're connected to the remote machine via VS Code:

* Open the terminal by clicking on **"View" ‚Üí "Terminal"** in the top menu.
* This will open a terminal window at the bottom of the VS Code interface.

Then run the following command to clone the course repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexanderDhoore/<date>-mlops-workshop.git
```

Replace `<date>` with the actual date of your workshop.

This will download all course materials onto your virtual machine.

After cloning, to open the folder in **VS Code**:

* Click on **"File" ‚Üí "Open Folder..."**
* Navigate to the cloned folder (`<date>-mlops-workshops` in your home directory)
* Click **"OK"**
* VS Code may ask you if you **trust the authors** of this folder ‚Äì just click "Yes"

This will load the repository into your VS Code workspace so you can explore and edit files easily.

### Navigate to the first exercise folder

Inside the project, navigate to:

```
ml-infrastructure/01-running-the-notebook/
```

Here you‚Äôll find a training notebook that we‚Äôll use in the next step.

### Set up the Python environment in VS Code

<img src="../../media/vscode-notebook-demo.png" style="width: 300px" align="right">

Open the notebook file `grocery-store.ipynb` in VS Code and try running the cells.

When you try to run a cell, VS Code may prompt you to install recommended extensions like **Python** and **Jupyter**. Go ahead and install them if prompted.

Then, VS Code will ask you to **select a kernel**. Choose:

‚û°Ô∏è **Python Environments** ‚Üí **Create Python Environment**

Follow these steps:

1. **Select `Venv`** ‚Äì this creates a `.venv` folder in your current workspace.
2. **Choose the default interpreter** ‚Äì usually something like **Python 3.11**.
3. **For dependencies**, select the `requirements.txt` file inside the `01-running-the-notebook` folder.
4. Click **‚ÄúOK‚Äù**.

VS Code will now automatically create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies.

### üí° Note for advanced users

If you prefer to set up the environment manually via the terminal, you can do so:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then reopen the notebook and select this virtual environment as your kernel (top-right of the notebook).

### Run the notebook

Once the setup is complete, try running the notebook cells again.

You should now see:

* A training loop using MobileNetV3.
* Output showing training loss and validation accuracy.
* Some example predictions visualized inline.

Congratulations! You've just trained and evaluated your first image classifier.

### See what changed in the notebook

Before moving on, let‚Äôs take a moment to look at what actually changed when you ran the notebook.

**If you haven't already, save the notebook. CTRL+S**

#### üß≠ Using the VS Code interface:

1. Click on the **Source Control** icon in the left-hand sidebar (the one that looks like a branch or Y-shape).
2. You‚Äôll see one or more **pending changes** listed‚Äîmost notably, `grocery-store.ipynb`.
3. Click on the notebook file in the list to see a **visual diff**.

VS Code will show you what changed inside the notebook:

* Execution counts
* Metadata like timestamps or kernel info
* Cell outputs (e.g. training progress, printed results)

Even though you **didn‚Äôt change your actual code**, you‚Äôll see a **lot of noise** in the diff. This is a great example of why notebooks are hard to track with Git. In fact, VS Code is already doing you a favour here ‚Äî it shows a **clean, human-readable view** of the notebook diff.

Behind the scenes, notebooks are saved as **large JSON files**, and things like metadata or image outputs are stored as raw data or base64-encoded blobs. These aren't easy to read or version properly. So while VS Code makes it look manageable, the actual file format is much messier.

#### üß† Viewing the Raw Notebook Diff

If you want to see what the notebook file really looks like under the hood, run:

```bash
git diff
```

This shows the raw contents of the `.ipynb` file ‚Äî which includes not just your code, but all kinds of metadata, and even full image outputs as base64 strings. It‚Äôs verbose and often unreadable.

This reinforces why we‚Äôll soon move from notebooks to Python scripts: plain `.py` files produce much cleaner diffs, are easier to version, and don‚Äôt clutter your Git history with unrelated noise.

#### Optional: Use `nbdime` for cleaner notebook diffs

If you want a more readable diff for notebooks on the command line, try using `nbdime`:

```bash
pip install nbdime
```

## ‚úÖ Next Step

Once you've successfully run the notebook, you're ready to move on to the next exercise: **refactoring the notebook into reusable Python scripts.**
