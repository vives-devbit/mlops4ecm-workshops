# 07 â€“ Compose Deployment

<img src="../../media/docker-compose-octopus.jpg" style="width: 300px" align="right">

> Use Docker Compose to launch your entire application stack (API + frontend) with a single command. Deploy your application to a production environment via GitHub or a Docker registry.

Combine your containers using Docker Compose to deploy both the backend and frontend as a single service. Run everything together with one command. Push your code to GitHub and deploy it on a second virtual machine.

Bonus: sign up to dockerhub or quay.io and push your image there, then deploy your image from the registery (instead of building images on target)
