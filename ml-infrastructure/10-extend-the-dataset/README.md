# 10 â€“ Extend the Dataset

> Upload new images and labels through the frontend to expand your dataset. Add a new class, retrain your model, and re-evaluate performance.

Extend your frontend to allow uploading new images from your phone or computer to your MinIO bucket. Add a new category (e.g. keyboard, monitor) to the dataset, retrain your model, and evaluate its performance.

- Write plotly dash code to allow uploading new images
- Configure it to work with your S3 minio server
- Add a new category to the dataset and upload some images
- Retrain your model to support the new category
