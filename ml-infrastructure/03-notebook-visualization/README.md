IDEA Notebooks are still really great for exploring and visualizing! Don't forget that.
Now that we have refactored Python code we can create multiple notebooks to  explore different things.

- Load model and visualize confusion matrix
- Load dataset and visualize class imbalance

Add a post-training evaluation step that visualizes the model's performance using a confusion matrix. Understand where your model is making mistakes, and explore predictions for individual images using matplotlib.
