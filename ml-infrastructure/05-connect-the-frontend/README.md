> Integrate a Dash-based frontend with your API. Let users upload images and see model predictions in a web interface.

You are provided with a working frontend built using Plotly Dash. Your job is to connect it to your FastAPI backend. Once integrated, users will be able to upload images and see predictions directly in the web interface.

Bonus: students can try to improve the frontend in certain ways. They can learn some plotly dash.
