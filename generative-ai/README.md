# Practical Generative AI: Building and Deploying Custom Applications

## üß≠ Lab Overview

<img src="../media/generative-ai.png" style="width: 300px" align="right">

Welcome to the **Generative AI Workshop** ‚Äî a hands-on experience where you'll build a complete, interactive generative AI application from scratch. Using pre-trained large language models, vision models, and diffusion-based image generators, you'll gradually construct a storytelling app that transforms into a rich, multimodal user experience.

This course focuses on creativity, iteration, and practical deployment. Each lab adds new capabilities to your project ‚Äî from generating text and analyzing images to deploying an interactive Gradio interface.

### Lab 1 ‚Äì [Run Your First Language Model](01-first-language-model)

Connect to a virtual machine and run your first large language model. You'll experiment with talking to it, try out different models, and benchmark their performance.

### Lab 2 ‚Äì [Turn Your LLM into a Storyteller](02-storytelling-assistant)

Explore how to guide a large language model by writing system and user prompts. By the end, you'll have built a storytelling assistant that can generate creative stories based on your own ideas and style.

### Lab 3 ‚Äì [Add an Image to Guide the Story](03-add-input-image)

Learn how to use images as input for generative AI ‚Äî first to describe or classify them, and then to guide a story created by a large language model.

### Lab 4 ‚Äì [Chain Model Calls to Build Multi-Part Stories](04-multi-part-stories)

Use the LLM more creatively by calling it multiple times: first to generate a table of contents, then to write individual story chapters. Structure your code as a pipeline of prompts and outputs.

### Lab 5 ‚Äì [Illustrate the Story with Generated Images](05-generated-images)

Bring your AI-generated stories to life by adding custom illustrations using a diffusion model. First, you‚Äôll explore how to generate images from text, and then you‚Äôll combine everything into a single system that creates both story and visuals together.

### Lab 6 ‚Äì [Build a Simple Gradio App](06-simple-gradio-app)

Build simple Gradio web apps that connect user inputs to language and vision models, enabling real-time AI-powered interactions. You create apps for text generation, image generation, image analysis, and even a stateful chatbot ‚Äî all running locally on your virtual machine.

### Lab 7 ‚Äì [Create an Interactive Storytelling App](07-interactive-app)

Turn the storytelling project into a full interactive Gradio application. Let the user make decisions between chapters that guide the story‚Äôs direction. Automatically generate chapter text and branching choices.

### Lab 8 ‚Äì [Explore Other Modalities](08-other-modalities)

Broaden your generative AI toolkit by experimenting with additional input and output modalities beyond text and images. In this final lab, you‚Äôll explore new types of models ‚Äî such as **speech-to-text**, **music generation** and **document question answering**.

## üöÄ Goal of the Workshop

By the end of these labs, you'll have built and deployed a complete generative AI application that:

- Generates stories using **large language models**
- Understands and uses **images as input**
- Creates custom illustrations with **diffusion models**
- Offers an interactive storytelling experience through a **web interface**

You'll also gain practical experience with tools like **Ollama**, **Hugging Face Transformers**, **Stable Diffusion**, and **Gradio** ‚Äî running entirely on a GPU-powered Linux virtual machine through VS Code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Basic Python scripting (functions, variables, loops)
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks
- Some exposure to how ML models are used
- No need to train your own models ‚Äî all are pre-trained and ready to use
